        Even though Israel is a small country it is always in the news. The news continues to report on Jews moving to
        Israel, on the technology invented there, but also on conflict, wars and tensions with surrounding people. Why?
        A look at Israel’s history in the book of Genesis in the Bible reveals that 4000 years ago a man, who is now
        very well known, went on a camping trip in that part of the world. The Bible says that his story affects our
        future.

        This ancient man is Abraham (also known as Abram).  We can take his story seriously because the places and
        cities he visited are mentioned in other old writings.Audio Player
